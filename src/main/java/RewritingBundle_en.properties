apply = By our hypothesis %s, we know that %s is true if %s is true.
assumption = True, because it is one of our assumptions.
bullet = %s Case %s:
destruct = Let us consider the different possible cases of %s.
intros.assume = Assume that %s are arbitrary objects of type %s respectively. 
intros.suppose = Suppose that %s are true. 
intros.goal = Let us show that %s is true.
intuition = Intuitively, we know that %s is true.
inversion = By inversion on %s, we know that %s are also true.
omega = Using William Pugh's Omega algorithm, we can determine that this is true.
reflexivity = True.
simpl = By simplifying %s, we obtain that it is equivalent to %s.
unfold = By replacing %s with its definition, we obtain %s.
